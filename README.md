# VRGrove
Arduino sketch and corresponding Unity (C#) code to transfer Grove Trackball data into Unity for the purpose of movement tracking

This has both the arduino sketch and the Unity code necessary to transfer physical movement to a GROVE MINI TRACKBALL attached to the arduino into Unity.


Components Needed:
1) Would not be possible without WRMHL
